Create a microservice which serves the contents of player.csv through REST API.

The service should expose two REST endpoints:

    1. GET /api/players - returns the list of all players.
    2. GET /api/players/{playerID} - returns a single player by ID.

After implementing the basic functionality consider the following (as time allows): testing, edge cases, optimizations, deployment.

Instructions:

    1. Please send your solution back within 24 hours.
    2. We're not looking at a "perfect" solution, but we are looking for a high level of code.
    3. After implementing the basic functionality, consider the following - Error and Exception handling, testing and edge cases (must), pagination, rest standards and etc. (Performance and deployment can be considered "time permitting")
    4. Document what you would do additionally or differently if you had infinite time.
    5. You should use JAVA as programming language, and can choose any framework / library / data storage.
    6. If you have any implementation questions: make an assumption that makes the most sense, write it down, and go ahead with implementation.

Have fun with it!
